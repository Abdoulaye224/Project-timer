### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Project-timer, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](https://github.com/Project-timer/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [debugging guide](https://flight-manual.Project-timer.io/hacking-Project-timer/sections/debugging/)** for tips ‚Äî you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using [the latest version of Project-timer](https://flight-manual.Project-timer.io/hacking-Project-timer/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version) and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [Project-timer's or packages' config settings](https://flight-manual.Project-timer.io/hacking-Project-timer/sections/debugging/#check-Project-timer-and-package-settings).
* **Check if there's already [a package](https://Project-timer.io/packages) which provides that enhancement.**
* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#Project-timer-and-packages).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3AProject-timer)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#Project-timer-and-packages) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Project-timer which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Project-timer users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community package](#Project-timer-and-packages).
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version of Project-timer you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `Project-timer -v` in your terminal, or by starting Project-timer and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/Project-timer/command-palette).
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**
